From command line:

>git clone “url …..” to_folder (from url to local folder)

Do some editing of a file that we can want to modify

>git diff (will show the difference due to changes)

If we are satisfied:

>git add file_name

Create a local branch:

>git checkout –b branch_name

Git switches to the new branch. Now commit the changes:

>git commit –m “write a meaningful comment”

See what is done so far:
>git log

Send the changes to devtopia:
>git push –u origin branch_name

On the web – go to devtopia and compare. Create a pull request, get it approved … (the rest is like any other process)
